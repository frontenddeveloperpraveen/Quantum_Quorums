# Problem Statement: AutoML Tool for PreProd Corp

## Overview

PreProd Corp requires a user-friendly, freely available UI for training AI/ML models using various datasets. This AutoML tool should enable users to upload datasets, perform basic data cleansing, and train multiple AI/ML models. The tool should also provide users with the pickled files of the trained models.

## Objectives

As a BUILDATHON participating team, your objectives are to:

1. _Develop a Frontend and Backend_:

   - Create an intuitive user interface (UI) that allows users to input datasets in CSV or Excel format.
   - Develop a robust backend to handle data processing, model training, and storage.

2. _Data Input and Cleansing_:

   - Ensure the uploaded datasets undergo basic data cleansing to make them compatible for AI/ML model training.

3. _Model Training_:

   - Use the cleansed data to train at least five different popular AI/ML models.
   - Ensure the tool can identify and provide the best-performing model based on certain evaluation metrics.

4. _Model Output_:
   - Allow users to download the pickled files of all the trained models or the best-performing model.

## Requirements

### Frontend

- _File Upload_:
  - Allow users to upload datasets in CSV or Excel format.
- _Data Preview_:
  - Display a preview of the uploaded dataset.
- _Cleansing Options_:
  - Provide basic options for data cleansing (e.g., handling missing values, removing duplicates).
- _Training Options_:
  - Enable users to select the type of models to be trained.
- _Model Evaluation_:
  - Display evaluation metrics and performance comparison of different models.
- _Download Option_:
  - Provide download links for the pickled files of the trained models.

### Backend

- _Data Handling_:
  - Implement functionalities to upload, store, and preview datasets.
- _Data Cleansing_:
  - Ensure the dataset is clean and compatible for model training (e.g., handle missing values, categorical encoding).
- _Model Training_:
  - Train at least five popular AI/ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks).
- _Model Evaluation_:
  - Evaluate models using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- _Pickle Models_:
  - Save the trained models as pickle files.
- _Best Model Selection_:
  - Identify and highlight the best-performing model.
- _APIs_:
  - Develop APIs to handle frontend requests for uploading data, starting model training, and downloading pickled models.

## Deliverables

1. _Frontend Code_:
   - UI design and implementation for dataset upload, data cleansing, model training options, and results display.
2. _Backend Code_:
   - Server-side logic for handling file uploads, data processing, model training, evaluation, and pickling.
3. _Documentation_:
   - Comprehensive documentation explaining the system architecture, setup instructions, and usage guide.
4. _Presentation_:
   - A brief presentation demonstrating the functionalities and features of the AutoML tool.

## Evaluation Criteria

- _User Interface_: Ease of use and intuitiveness of the UI.
- _Functionality_: Completeness and correctness of the data cleansing and model training processes.
- _Performance_: Efficiency and speed of model training and evaluation.
- _Documentation_: Clarity and completeness of the provided documentation.
- _Innovation_: Novelty and innovation in the solution approach.

## Tools and Technologies

- _Frontend_: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind.
- _Backend_: Python, Django, pandas, scikit-learn.
- _Database_: SQLite.
- _Version Control_: GitHub.
